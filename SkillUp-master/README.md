# RoadmapAI

This is a Next.js application that uses AI to generate dynamic, personalized roadmaps for any goal or career path.

## Project Description

RoadmapAI is a web application built with Next.js that leverages the power of AI to help users visualize and plan their journeys towards achieving a specific goal or navigating a career path. By providing a description of their objective, users can receive a dynamic, step-by-step roadmap generated by the AI. The application incorporates features like user authentication, theme customization, and a responsive user interface built with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components. The AI generation is powered by a Genkit-based backend with specific flows designed for generating roadmaps and providing advice.

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.
